✅ Explanation of the Java Code
1. Import statements
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;


Scanner → lets you take input from the user.

Random → generates the secret random number.

These two are essential for the game.

2. Variable setup + main structure
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
Random rand = new Random();

int totalScore = 0;
boolean playAgain = true;


totalScore → adds points for each round.

playAgain → controls whether the game continues.

3. Game loop (this allows multiple rounds)
while (playAgain) {


As long as playAgain is true, it keeps starting new rounds of the game.

4. Generate the random number
int number = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;


rand.nextInt(100) gives a number from 0–99

Adding +1 makes it 1–100
This is the user’s secret number to guess.

5. Attempts setup
int attempts = 0;
int maxAttempts = 7;


You track how many attempts the user used.

maxAttempts is the limit.

6. The guessing loop
while (attempts < maxAttempts) {


This loop keeps asking the user for guesses until they either guess correctly or run out of chances.

7. Take user's guess
System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
int guess = sc.nextInt();
attempts++;


User enters a number

You increment attempts each time

8. Check the guess
if (guess == number) {
    System.out.println("Correct! You guessed it in " + attempts + " attempts.");
    totalScore += (maxAttempts - attempts + 1);
    break;
}
else if (guess > number) {
    System.out.println("Too high!");
}
else {
    System.out.println("Too low!");
}


Here's what happens:

If user guesses right → break the loop

If guess is too high → tell them

If guess is too low → tell them

Score calculation is based on how fast they guessed

9. If they fail all attempts
if (attempts == maxAttempts) {
    System.out.println("Out of attempts! The correct number was: " + number);
}


If they used all attempts and still didn’t guess correctly, reveal the number.

10. Ask if they want to play again
System.out.print("Play again? (yes/no): ");
String option = sc.next().toLowerCase();
playAgain = option.equals("yes");


If user types "yes" → next round

If not → game ends

11. Final score + exit
System.out.println("Your total score: " + totalScore);
System.out.println("Thanks for playing!");


Once they stop playing, you show the final score and end the program.
